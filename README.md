## FAQ ##

### Q: Why am I releasing it? ###
A: Why not? Maybe someone can learn something from it. Besides, sitting unfinished in my hard drive is certainly less useful.

### Q: Is the game finished? ###
A: Yes and no. A sufficient amount of gameplay has been implemented to consider it "finished". But I never managed to finish a proper "complete game experience", and don't think I'll ever dedicate enough time to it.

### Q: Is the code any good? ###
A: I've seen way worse.

### Q: Why the license? ###
A: Because I don't care about others making whatever they want with it... as long as they don't make the world a worse place.

### Q: What could be worse that the world as it is now? ###
A: Among other things: a world with more weapons; a world with more violence. a world with less equality; a world with a climate catastrophe; a world with more discrimination. Also, a world where open source code is used to create more shitty ads-saturated mobile games. Please, don't do that.

### Q: Don't you care if someone else makes a lot of money with your code? ###
A: It takes a lot of work (and even more luck) to make money from a game, specially an abstract puzzle game. Also, I don't care much about money.
Having said that, I would much welcome an invitation for a glass of wine or dinner from anyone who manages to make enough money from it to be able to afford it.
